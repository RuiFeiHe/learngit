This is a start up for learning git.
Hello beautiful world!

The first lesson 
use 'git add readme.txt' and 'git commit -m "..." '

The second lesson
After break and return to work, use 'git status' to check if anything is changed

if somthing is changed but not added, use 'git diff'

knowing the difference, we can then add the changed files and commit.
